# Ordometry
Ordometry robot with error correction. Using an MD25 library.

Have fun using, tweaking, improving on this code. It took me a while to get the error correction but I could have also used
arduino's PID library. However a friend of mine tried this and it never came to fruition.

BLAHBLAHBLAHLAH

Enjoy.
